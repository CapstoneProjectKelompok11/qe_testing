#Feature: Floor
#  As an admin
#  I want to create data floor
#  So that I can add data floor of building
#
#  Background:
#    Given I have logged in as admin
#    And I get token from the response
#
#  Scenario Outline: POST - As an admin I have to be able to create data floor of building
#    Given I set an endpoint for POST floor
#    When I request POST detail floor with "<statusAuthorize>", input <buildingId>, "<name>", "<type>", "<floor_size>", <max_capacity>, <starting_price> and "<facilities>"
#    Then I validate the status code for post floor is <statusCode>
#    And validate the "<message>" and data details after post floor
#    Examples:
#      | statusAuthorize | buildingId | name         | type            | floor_size | max_capacity | starting_price | facilities | statusCode | message      |
#      | not authorized  | 0          |              |                 |            | 0            | 0              |            | 403        | unauthorized |
