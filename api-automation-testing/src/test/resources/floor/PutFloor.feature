#  Background:
#    Given I have logged in as admin
#    And I get token admin from the response
#

#    Given I set an endpoint for PUT edit floor
#    When I request PUT detail edit floor with "<statusAuthorize>", input <floorId>, "<name>", "<type>", "<floor_size>", <max_capacity>, and <starting_price>
