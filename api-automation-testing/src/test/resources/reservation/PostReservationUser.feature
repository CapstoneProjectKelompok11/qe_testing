Feature: Create Reservation User
  As a user
  I want to create reservation
  So that I can add data reservation of building

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as user
    And I get token from the response

  Scenario Outline: POST - As a user I have to be able to create data reservation
    Given I set an endpoint for POST reservation user
    When I request POST detail reservation user with "<statusAuthorize>", input <floorId>, "<startReservation>", "<company>", "<phone>", <participant>, and "<note>"
    Then I validate the status code for post reservation user is <statusCode>
    And validate the "<message>" and data details after post reservation user
    Examples:
      | statusAuthorize | floorId | startReservation | company | phone   | participant | note | statusCode | message      |
