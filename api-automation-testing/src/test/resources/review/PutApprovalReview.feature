Feature: Approval Review
  As an admin
  I want to approval review
  So that I can add data review of building

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as admin
    And I get token admin from the response

  Scenario Outline: PUT - As an admin I have to be able to approval review
    Given I set an endpoint for PUT approval review
    When I request PUT detail approval review with "<statusAuthorize>" and input "<userId>", <buildingId>, and "<approved>"
    Then I validate the status code for put approval review is <statusCode>
    And validate the "<message>" and data details after put approval review
    Examples:
      | statusAuthorize | userId  | buildingId | approved | statusCode | message      |
      | not authorized  |         | 0          |          | 403        | unauthorized |
      | authorized      |         | 0          |          | 400        | not found    |
      | authorized      |         | 5          | true     | 400        | not found    |
      | authorized      | existed | 0          | true     | 400        | not found    |
