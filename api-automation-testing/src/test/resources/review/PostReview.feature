Feature: Create Review
  As a user
  I want to create data review
  So that I can add data review of building

  Background:
    Given I have logged in as user
    And I get token from the response

  Scenario Outline: POST - As a user I have to be able to create data review of building
    Given I set an endpoint for POST review
#    When I request POST detail review with "<statusAuthorize>" and input <buildingId>, "<review>", and <rating>
    When I request POST detail review with "<statusReview>", "<statusAuthorize>" and input <buildingId>, "<review>", and <rating>
    Then I validate the status code for post review is <statusCode>
    And validate the "<message>" and data details after post review
    Examples:
      | statusReview | statusAuthorize | buildingId | review | rating | statusCode | message      |
      |              | not authorized  | 0          |        | 0      | 403        | unauthorized |
      |              | authorized      | 0          |        | 0      | 400        | not found    |
