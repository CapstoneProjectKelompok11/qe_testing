#Feature: Edit Data Profile
#  As a user
#  I want to edit data profile
#  So that I can access the detail data user
#
#  Background:
#    Given I have logged in as user
#    And I get token from the response
#
#  Scenario Outline: PUT - As a user I have to be able to edit data profile
#    Given I set an endpoint for PUT profile
#    When I request PUT  detail profile with "<statusAuthorize>", input "<firstName>", "<lastName>", "<phone>", and "<email>"
#    Then I validate the status code for put profile is <statusCode>
#    And validate the data details and the "<message>" after edit profile
#    Examples:
#      | statusAuthorize | firstName | lastName | phone       | email   | statusCode | message      |
#      | not authorized  |           |          |             |         | 403        | unauthorized |
#      | authorized      |           |          |             |         | 400        | existed      |
#      | authorized      | user      | name     | 08123456789 |         | 400        | required     |
#      | authorized      | user      | name     |             | existed | 200        | success      |
#      | authorized      | user      |          | 08123456789 | existed | 200        | success      |
#      | authorized      |           | name     | 08123456789 | existed | 200        | success      |
#      | authorized      | user      | name     | 08123456789 | invalid | 400        | required     |
#      | authorized      | user      | name     | 08123456789 | new     | 200        | success      |
